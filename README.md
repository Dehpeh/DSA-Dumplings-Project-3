What is this masterpiece you might ask? Well, let's start from the beginning. Once upon a time, there was a Daniel Tiger who wanted to go to a concert of a random artist that he found on a poster on a lamppost. But in order to go to the concert, he needed to learn the songs on the setlist. HOWEVER, how was he going to achieve his goal?

Enter: Spotify Song Guessr.

With Spotify Song Guessr, Daniel Tiger was able to memorize all the songs and sing his heart out during the concert! Wow!
